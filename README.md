# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe simulator created using python programmed within a jupyter notebook. It can save and record statistics for players, has different difficulty modes, and can be played with two people. On the highest difficulty, it is impossible for players to win; a tie or loss is guaranteed.

The command to start playing is startmenu(). Have fun!
